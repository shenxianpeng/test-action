# C/C++ Lint Action Test Repository

[![cpp-linter-master](https://github.com/shenxianpeng/test-cpp-linter-action/actions/workflows/cpp-lint-master.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/shenxianpeng/test-cpp-linter-action/actions/workflows/cpp-lint-master.yaml)

This is a test repository which has added `cpp-linter.yml`, so when an unformatted c/c++ source file was committed and create a Pull Request will automatically recognize and add warning comments.

If you have any suggestions or contributions, welcome to create issues/PRs [here](https://github.com/shenxianpeng/cpp-linter-action).
